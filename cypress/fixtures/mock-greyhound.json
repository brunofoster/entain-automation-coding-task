Good beginner but will need a little luck early crossing from on outside draw. Can make amends this time. HOOKED ON JACK (10) has a strong record this trip including three wins from six starts. Placed last time (25.70) at Muswellbrook in a Grade 5, finishing second and beaten a nose. With even luck and a clean start can sneak into the finish. Wouldn't surprise to see last-start winner REDSHIFT CHARLIE (3) feature in the finish again.",
